# Entertainment Industry Time & Expense Tracker

## Introduction

I am a solo developer creating an app for my friends and colleagues in the live entertainment and broadcast industry. This app is designed to help professionals track their hours, labor, invoicing, and expenses tied to a job number. Please note that this app is not intended for commercial use by other companies to make money.

I will provide the code as open-source and will try to host it for free or as cheaply as possible for as long as I can.
