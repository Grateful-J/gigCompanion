Responsive Design:
Mobile-First Approach: Ensure that all elements are styled to look good on small screens by default and then progressively enhance for larger screens using media queries.
Containers: Use container, mx-auto, and p-4 to center content and provide padding.
Flexbox Utilities: Use flex, flex-col, lg:flex-row, justify-center, items-center, and lg:items-start to create flexible and responsive layouts.
Responsive Spacing: Use space-y-4, lg:space-x-4, p-4, lg:p-8 to provide appropriate spacing on different screen sizes.
